Information about research papers such as full abstract, title of the article and date of publication was given.
Each article is identified by a unique id. The task is to predict the list of unique ids of research papers cited by every paper.

Approach:
Abstract and title of the article were lemmatized. Then map reduce was applied to get the count of each unique word (in abstract and title)
and top 10 words were retained in each row. Then number of common words between a row and every other row was found out. 
Then for each row, top 13 unique ids were predicted as cited papers based on the number of common words.
